Hello, to use our application, it is necessary:
1) Run the application with "server" as argument in a command prompt.
2) Run the application with "client" as argument in another command prompt.

In the client part, u can use two commands to communicate with the server:
1) /clients : the server will give you users logged in with their ip adress.
2) /quit: you will be disconnected from the server.
